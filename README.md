## 📌 Project Title: Zomato Dashboard

### 📝 Problem Statement

* Analyze customer preferences.
* Understand restaurant performance.
* Identify food trends across regions.
* Improve decision-making with data-driven insights.

This project aims to solve this by creating an **interactive dashboard** that visualizes Zomato data in a meaningful and business-friendly way.
